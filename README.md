# Vacant Home Management System

This project is an *IoT and AI-based home automation system* for vacant homes. It uses *ROS 2* for capturing camera feeds, *Intel OneAPI* for intruder and pet detection, and Arduino for monitoring sensors like temperature, humidity, and controlling devices like fans and feeders.

## Features

- *Intruder Detection*: Uses AI to monitor camera feeds and alert for intruders.
- *Pet Feeding Automation*: Automatically feeds pets based on detection or schedule.
- *IoT Sensors*: Monitors temperature, humidity, and environmental conditions.

## Tech Stack

- *ROS 2* for camera and sensor data handling.
- *Intel OneAPI* for real-time AI processing.
- *Arduino* for IoT device control.

## Usage

1. Start the ROS 2 camera node for capturing images.
2. Run AI detection using Intel OneAPI for intruders and pets.
3. Monitor sensors and control devices via Arduino.
